- [ ] 6. Implement feature service

  - Files: [src/services/FeatureService.ts, src/services/BaseService.ts, src/utils/error.ts]
  - Create concrete service implementation using FeatureModel

- [ ] 7. Add service dependency injection

  - Files: [src/utils/di.ts, src/services/FeatureService.ts]
  - Register FeatureService in dependency injection container
  - Configure service lifetime and dependencies
  - Purpose: Enable service injection throughout application
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Create service unit tests

  - Files: [tests/services/FeatureService.test.ts, tests/services/BaseService.test.ts]
  - Write tests for service methods with mocked dependencies
  - Test error handling scenarios
  - Purpose: Ensure service reliability and proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Create API endpoints

  - Design API structure
  - _Requirements: 4_

- [ ] 9.1 Set up routing and middleware

  - Set up error handling middleware
  - _Requirements: 4.1_

- [ ] 9.2 Implement CRUD endpoints

  - Create API endpoints
  - Add request validation
  - Write API integration tests
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 10. Add frontend components

  - Plan component architecture
  - _Requirements: 5.1_

- [ ] 10.1 Create base UI components

  - Set up component structure
  - Implement reusable components
  - Add styling and theming
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 10.2 Implement feature-specific components

  - Create feature components
  - Add state management
  - Connect to API endpoints
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 11. Integration and testing

  - Plan integration approach
  - _Requirements: All_

- [ ] 11.1 Write end-to-end tests

  - Set up E2E testing framework
  - Write user journey tests
  - Add test automation
  - _Requirements: All_

- [ ] 11.2 Final integration and cleanup

  - Integrate all components
  - Fix any integration issues
  - Clean up code and documentation
  - _Requirements: All_

## Atomic Task Requirements

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**

- **File Scope**: Touches 1-4 related files maximum
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Specify files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Include files' paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles

## Good vs Bad Task Examples

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

❌ **Bad Examples (Too Broad)**:

- "Implement authentication system" (affects too many files, multiple purposes)
- "Add user management features" (vague scope, no files specification)
- "Build complete dashboard" (too large, multiple components)

✅ **Good Examples (Atomic)**:

- "Create User model with email/password fields"
- "Add password hashing utility using bcrypt"
- "Create LoginForm component with email/password inputs"
